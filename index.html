        <p>20v1 Guy is a nickname given to LKGainss, a Canadian fitness trainer and content creator 
        who went viral on TikTok in early 2025 for posting videos in which he asks why he gets 
        "negative aura and cancelled" for allegedly winning a 20 vs. one fight. The "20v1" videos 
        began in February 2025 when LKGainss documented himself traveling back to his old high 
        school and wrestling with kids, claiming that he was jumped by 20 students while there. 
        LKGainss proceeded to post many videos mentioning the 20v1 altercation, inspiring some 
        fans to tell him he was "dragging" the meme. Previously, in 2023, LKGainss garnered 
        online attention as the "biggest 18 year old in high school" after a comedy video of him 
        beating kids up in a school went viral.</p>
